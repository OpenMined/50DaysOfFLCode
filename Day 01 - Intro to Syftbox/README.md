# What is Syftbox?

Before we dive into building cool programs and apps throughout this 50-day federated learning journey, let’s first get familiar with the platform we’ll be using—Syftbox. Syftbox is a platform designed to build apps and projects that serve groups of individuals by securely accessing and aggregating verified private data. The three most important things Syftbox does are accessing private information securely, aggregating it, and verifying it. Currently under development, Syftbox will be the primary platform for our 50 Days of FL program, providing the foundation for all the awesome projects you’ll build.

# Install Syftbox

Here is the one-line installer for Syftbox on macOS.
Running this script will both install Syftbox and start your Syftbox client.
```
curl -LsSf https://syftboxstage.openmined.org/install.sh | sh
```

# Part 3: See Yourself on Network

- check datasites listing
- UPGRADE: check syft_stats.html (TODO: fix logged_in bug after syncing can definitely handle it)

# Part 4: Say Hello to Everyone!

- create an html page and see it on the network

# Part 5: Explore other datasites! (and maybe look for data)

- (link to aziz's datasite browser)
- (link to some other interesting/popular/interactive pages)

# Congratulations!!

- tomorrow you'll build your first federated app

# Bonus: customize your page!
