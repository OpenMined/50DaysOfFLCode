>

# Part 1: Introduction

Success Criteria:

- remind people why 50DaysofFL is good
- problem: pets are hard to build/research
- solution: syftbox makes it easier to deploy federated learning applications (have a favourite FL platform/algorithm? request a tutorail and we'll make one for you)

# Part 2: Install & Connect to Federated Network

- 1 linear for installation
- Link to troubleshooting / Github Issues / #support on slack

# Part 3: See Yourself on Network

- check datasites listing
- UPGRADE: check syft_stats.html (TODO: fix logged_in bug after syncing can definitely handle it)

# Part 4: Say Hello to Everyone!

- create an html page and see it on the network

# Part 5: Explore other datasites! (and maybe look for data)

- (link to aziz's datasite browser)
- (link to some other interesting/popular/interactive pages)

# Congratulations!!

- tomorrow you'll build your first federated app

# Bonus: customize your page!
