> TL;DR: Machine learning has developed at a frantic pace, where ideals such as data privacy and the centralisation of compute have remained an afterthought. We introduce SyftBox, the world’s first global data playground that is built from these missing ideals from first principles. We call this _the broad listening Internet_. Stick around to find out how to get involved!


## What is the Broad-Listening Internet? 
On the "broad casting" internet, YOU can message a million people.
On the "broad listening" internet, a million people can message back...
...and YOU can hear their collective reply.

In the background visualization:
YOU represent an individual in the network.
Multi-colored pulses show your message spreading across the network.
Grey pulses represent responses returning to you.

How it works:
Listen at scale using LLMs/statistics to summarize millions of replies.
to non-public information protected by privacy enhancing technology (FL, DP, etc.)
that's verified to be true by asking a million eye-witnesses and comparing their replies.

... and in a way you can become superintelligent yourself.

## Why do we want this? 

You can speak to a million people online, but you can only listen to one person at a time — only about information they can safely share — and you can't know if they accurately describe the world (i.e. are truthful). Consequently, the internet has too much information to process, much of it is false, and it's missing honest accounts of the personal (i.e. private) issues that really matter. These three challenges undermine society's most important institutions, such as:

Free speech is only as free as the freedom of others of listen. (but they can't)
Free markets are only as free as the ability for sellers to hear buyers' real needs (but they can't)
Free democracy is only as free as the ability for leaders to hear their voters real needs. (but they can't)

> The truth is, in a sea of people shouting online, hardly anyone can be heard. But it's not that the internet for broadcasting is broken — it's that the internet for broad listening is missing.

## How do we solve the issue?
The solution is a new internet by which one person can broadcast to a million people, and then hear their reply, overcoming the three challenges preventing those replies from being heard:

Overload hearing a million replies is too much information to process.
Privacy people can't broadcast information that might get mis-used.
Verification receivers of information can't know if it accurately describes the world.

These three challenges can be overcome by combining three technologies:
Listen at scale using LLMs/statistics to summarize millions of replies.
to non-public information protected by privacy enhancing technology (FL, DP, etc.)
that's verified to be true by asking a million eye-witnesses and comparing their replies.

## The Finale of Information Technology
Every person will speak to and listen to every other person (on earth) all the time, instantly, and for free.

Before you buy a product you'll ask every other person who ever bought it if it works.
Before a law is passed a democratic leader will talk with every person it might affect.
Before you make a decision you can ask every other person who made that decision whether it worked.

... and just like that you will become superintelligent.

## The world needs YOU!
Before this vision can be a reality, a new generation of web developers needs to build the second half of the internet (using LLMs, PETs, and peer-to-peer technology). This is a tutorial for how to get started...

## Introducing SyftBox

SyftBox is the browser to the `broad listening internet`, but it's less like a browser, and more like:

- `A file-syncing system` which you share with the rest of the internet (note: the internet is a giant filesystem) 
- `with novel file permissions` based on privacy enhancing technologies (which protect you) 
- `and background tasks` which reply to questions people ask you while you're away.

Below you can see the network of people connected to the broad listening internet. By the end of this page, you'll see your name here too!

## Installing SyftBox Guide
### Step 1: Install and Run
Installing SyftBox is as easy as:
```bash
curl -LsSf https://syftbox.openmined.org/datasites/subha@openmined.org/install.sh | sh
```
We have made everything crisp and clean so that we take care of all of the heavy lifting for you.
### Step 2: Run Syftbox
Finally, let's run the SyftBox client:
```bash
uv run syftbox client
```
This command will startup the SyftBox client, connecting you to the broad listening network. If this is your first time, the client will ask you several questions.

Once you've answered the questions and the SyftBox client has started, look for your email on the network.

### Step 6: Pat yourself on the back!
> Congratulations!

You've successfully installed and run SyftBox. You're now ready to explore the broad listening internet. Follow along here to `Day 01` of the `50-DAYS-OF-FL-CODE`.
